## Introduction
Agriculture is the most important sector in most African countries. It contributes about **30%** of the continent GDP and about **50%** of its exports. Of the 1 billion people in Africa, **70%** depend on agriculture for their livelihood.     
Nowadays, with the continuous growth of population, agrotechnique is also in constant innovation, many new technologies and data are also applied in farming and production, to promote the sustainable development of agriculture.
This project aims to use technological innovations such as Digital Earth Africa, Open Data Cube, Earth observation and so on to help the South African government and farmers better develop agricultural activities and make decisions  and promoting socio-ecological sustainable development.

## Point of View
The South African government needs to ensure food security and agriculture development on the basis of maintaining socio-ecological sustainable development because they lack the ability to scientifically and systematically make analysis and decisions.
