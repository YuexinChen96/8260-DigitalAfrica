## Introduction
Urbanization rate is an important indicator of urban sustainability. Rapid, unplanned urbanization may 
lead to adverse social, economic and environmental consequences due to inadequate and overburdened infrastructure 
and services. However, there are many challenges to urban sustainability in Africa. 
This project aims to use technological innovations such as data cubes (Earth observation data; Digital Earth for Africa) 
to help Africa build more sustainable and prosperous social ecosystems for urbanization.

## Project Overview
Government and industry need to use some technological innovation platforms to collect information such as the trend of urbanization and the state of population flow 
in order to play a role in regular urban surveillance.
