## Introduction
Urbanization rate is an important indicator of urban sustainability. Rapid, unplanned urbanization may 
lead to adverse social, economic and environmental consequences due to inadequate and overburdened infrastructure 
and services. However, there are many challenges to urban sustainability in Africa. 
This project aims to use technological innovations such as data cubes (Earth observation data; Digital Earth for Africa) 
to help Africa build more sustainable and prosperous social ecosystems for urbanization.
